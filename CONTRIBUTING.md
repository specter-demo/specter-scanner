# Contributing to Specter Scanner

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Specter Scanner. This document explains how to contribute effectively.

## Before you start

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/spectersystems/specter-scanner/issues) to see if your idea or bug is already being tracked
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach before writing code
- All contributions are subject to the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE)

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectersystems/specter-scanner
cd specter-scanner
go mod download
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Requires Go 1.22 or later.

## Running tests

```bash
# Unit tests
make test

# Integration test against demo agents (requires AWS credentials)
make test-demo
```

All pull requests must pass `make test` with zero failures.

## Adding a new plugin

Plugins discover agents from a specific platform or data source. To add a new plugin:

1. Create `internal/plugin/yourplugin/yourplugin.go`
2. Implement the `ScanPlugin` interface from `internal/plugin/interface.go`
3. Register the plugin in `cmd/scanner/main.go`
4. Add unit tests — minimum coverage for happy path, empty result, and error cases
5. Add the plugin to the README discovery section
6. Submit a pull request

### Plugin implementation checklist

Before submitting a plugin PR, verify:

- [ ] Uses canonical resource identifiers as `externalId` (full ARNs for AWS, full URLs for others)
- [ ] Calls the platform's identity API for real account/org IDs — never uses config strings as resource identifiers
- [ ] Reads owner declarations from tags or manifest files before firing NHI findings
- [ ] Returns enrichment data for existing agents rather than creating duplicate records for matched resources
- [ ] Handles empty results gracefully (no agents found is valid, not an error)
- [ ] Rate-limits external API calls using the configured `--rate-limit` value
- [ ] Does not store credentials — reads from environment variables only
- [ ] Unit tests cover: agent found with owner tag, agent found without owner tag, no agents found, API error

## Adding a new finding rule

Finding rules detect specific security or governance gaps. To add a new rule:

1. Add the rule ID and description to `internal/types/findings.go`
2. Implement the detection logic in the appropriate plugin
3. Add unit tests covering: condition present (finding fires), condition absent (finding does not fire), owner tag present (NHI findings suppressed)
4. Add the rule to the findings table in `README.md`
5. Document the remediation path in the finding description

## Pull request process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Write your code and tests
4. Run `make test` — all tests must pass
5. Run `go vet ./...` and `golint ./...` — no warnings
6. Commit with a clear message: `feat: add GCP Cloud Run plugin`
7. Open a pull request against `main`

Pull requests are reviewed within 5 business days. We may request changes before merging.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:
- Specter Scanner version (`specter-scanner --version`)
- Operating system and Go version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior and error output

For security vulnerabilities, do not open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Code style

- Follow standard Go formatting: `gofmt -w .`
- Keep functions focused — if a function does more than one thing, split it
- Export only what external packages need
- Add comments on exported functions and types
- Avoid global state
